# README: Research Project on Low-Resource African Languages and Cultures

## **Project Overview**
This research focuses on improving culturally aligned Large Language Models (LLMs) for low-resource African languages. The goal is to develop scalable data collection methods and create benchmarks for better model evaluation.

## **Current Progress**
- Conducted literature review on culturally aligned LLMs.
- Identified WVS (World Values Survey) as a key dataset.
- Reviewing the state-of-the-art benchmark ([2412.12417](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.12417)).
- Planning model replication and benchmark validation.

## **Next Steps**
- Replicate the benchmark model.
- Improve upon benchmark performance.
- Develop a scalable data collection methodology.

This project aims to advance NLP research for low-resource African languages by addressing cultural alignment and data scarcity challenges.
